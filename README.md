a IMDB data viz attempt

I'm working on a project in @PY4E to visualise data from the IMDB dumps. I'm first working in importing CSV and TSV files into the sqlite3 db; that's working okay for now. Next things are to make the importers general-purpose by reading header fields.
Then work on the big dump dbs and make them relational.
Then start selecting the info I want to visualise
